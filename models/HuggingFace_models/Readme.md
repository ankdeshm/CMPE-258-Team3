# Transformer-based models from Hugging Face
Following models from Hugging Face are used for text-to-sql inference. Some of these models are also used in the demo. <br>
- gpt2Medium_text_to_sql 
- t5-small-awesome-text-to-sql
- Mistral-7B-SQL
- CodeLlama-7b-Instruct-SQL
- CodeLlama-13b-Instruct-SQL
- squeal
- T5-LM-Large-text2sql-spider
- schema-aware-denoising-bart-large-cnn-text2sql
- schema-aware-distilbart-cnn-12-6-text2sql

# Steps to Run
text2sql_huggingface.ipynb specifies the steps to run these models. Note that the notebook needs a restart after installing "accelerate" and "sentencepiece" packages.
