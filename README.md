# CMPE-258-Team3
# Text to SQL Conversion

## Application Area: Natural Language Processing

The primary objective of this project is to identify and finetune various existing approaches for Text-to-SQL conversion which accurately convert user-input natural language questions into corresponding SQL queries. This involves understanding the nuances of natural language, recognizing intent and context, and translating these into structured query language format. The project aims to make this translation as seamless and accurate as possible, catering to a wide range of queries from simple to complex. In order to determine which models work better, we intend to compare the performance of all the existing approaches.

## Datasets:
